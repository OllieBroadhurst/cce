# Team CCE Project
Repo for team CCE's project

Navigate to each team member's folder to see their code. This is *not* best practice but we'll merge them all later.
If you're going to reference any libraries outside of these folders don't forget to mention this in your import statement. E.g:
`from ollie.tree_chart import get_figure`

Much love x
